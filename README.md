Lexathon -- CS 3340 term project, fall 2016
====================================================

11/26/2016 - First readme entry. 
    fileio.asm : encompasses file I/O through macros; the initialization of dictionary structures; querying this structure; returning initial word. 
    test.asm : should be exactly the same as file I/O. It reflects the most up-to-date build that I've tested on my system. (maintained in separate buffer)
    ./Dictionaries : contain exactly that, plus another subfolder full of unused dictionaries. 
    notes.txt : references documenting niche technology features specific to implementations in MIPS; prevents me from making same mistakes twice
